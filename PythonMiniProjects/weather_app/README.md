# Windoser Weather App

A simple weather application built using Python and Tkinter to retrieve weather data using the WeatherAPI and display it in a graphical user interface.

## Functionality

- Retrieves weather data based on the selected city or the user's geolocation.
- If the city name input field is left empty and the submit button is clicked, it automatically detects the user's current location using geolocation.
- Displays the weather climate, wind speed, temperature, pressure, humidity, and cloud cover.
- Allows the user to select a city from a list of predefined options.
- Provides a submit button to initiate the retrieval of weather data.
- Utilizes the requests library to make HTTP requests to the WeatherAPI.
- Utilizes the geocoder library to retrieve the user's geolocation information.
